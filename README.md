# CSS iOS!

Some desktop environments can be styled with CSS and JS, e.g. the GNOME DE in Linux, and there are even mock ups of Windows 10 using CSS (https://codepen.io/MohamedElGhandour/pen/GEbwEW, https://github.com/kexanie/csswin10). Today, your task is to do up a mockup of the iOS homepage. You will find the default wallpaper, and 20 icon images, for your use in the appropriate folders here.

## Deliverables

* Re-create the following home screen in a web page as closely as possible, including the dock at the bottom of the screen. 

<img src="https://github.com/wdi-sg/css-ios/blob/master/Frame/HomeScreenMockup.png?raw=true" style="display:block;margin:0 auto;width:200px;">

### Further
* Write the app names without writing any text in a div.

* Make the battery icon slowly empty. You may use JS to achieve this.

* Make your screen responsive. The iPhone 5 supports 5 rows of 4 icons in portrait mode while the iPhone 8 Plus supports 6 rows of 4 icons in portrait mode, excluding the single row of icons in the dock. The iPad supports 5 rows of 4 icons in portrait mode.

### Further
* Make 2 pages of icons so that only 1 page is visible at any one time. You should be able to scroll from one page to the other and back smoothly.


## Useful tools
- The `:before` and `:after` selectors
- CSS filter - blur
